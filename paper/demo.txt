Questions from Xie:

1. System Requirements 
- (1) The current experiment PC specification (CPU, memory, Graphics board, etc.)
- (2) Supported sensor type: RGB? RGB-D? (Kinect 1, Kinect v2, Prime Sensor, etc.)
- (3) Multiple sensors supported?

2. 3D Reconstruction
- (1) How the data is acquired? (What kind of movement of sensor while taking image data? It is helpful, if the 3D trajectory of sensor is provided.)
- (2) How much time to take the image data?
- (3) How much time to compute the 3D reconstruction?

3. Post processing
- (1) As the result, is there a closed form 3D model, which is ready for 3D printing, available?
